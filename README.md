# Machine-Learning-Web-App
This project is a machine learning web application that predicts the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal dimensions. The application uses TensorFlow for model development, Streamlit for the front-end interface, Flask for serving the model, Docker for containerization, and Kubernetes for orchestration.

# Overview
This application allows users to input the dimensions of an iris flower and predict its species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) using a pre-trained machine learning model. The model is trained on the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in the field of machine learning.

# Features
  Interactive Front-End: User-friendly interface to input flower dimensions.
  Model Prediction: Real-time prediction of iris species.
  Scalable Deployment: Containerized with Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes.

# Technologies
